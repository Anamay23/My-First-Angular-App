# My-First-Angular-App
Wanted to learn basic Angular so created a webpage

Created a dummy webpage that uses a few introductory Angular principles. 
Used different components, data binding, passing data from parent to child component, event listeners, routing, services and pipes.

There is a counter component which allows you to increase, decrease or reset the count. 
The text box logs which is key is being pressed in the console, based on the KeyUp event listener.
I have used a router outlet to have 2 different pages - one for the home component that contains the welcome text, counter and text box and another page that contains the To-Do list.
The To-Do list injects data from an external API call (using Angular services) and it is possible to filter the To-Do list using pipes.
