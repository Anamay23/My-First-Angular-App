# FirstNgApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

# My-First-Angular-App
Wanted to learn basic Angular so created a webpage

Created a dummy webpage that uses a few introductory Angular principles. 
Used different components, data binding, passing data from parent to child component, event listeners, routing, services and pipes.

There is a counter component which allows you to increase, decrease or reset the count. 
The text box logs which is key is being pressed in the console, based on the KeyUp event listener.
I have used a router outlet to have 2 different pages - one for the home component that contains the welcome text, counter and text box and another page that contains the To-Do list.
The To-Do list injects data from an external API call (using Angular services) and it is possible to filter the To-Do list using pipes.
